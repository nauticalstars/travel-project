          <h2>Why Whistler?</h2>
          <h3>One of the largest ski resorts in North America</h3>
          <p>
            Whistler is a town north of Vancouver, British Columbia, that's home to Whistler Blackcomb, one of the
            largest
            ski
            resorts in North America. Besides skiing and snowboarding, the area offers snowshoeing, tobogganing and ski
            jumping at
            the Olympic Park, a venue for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. The hub of Whistler is a compact,
            chalet-style
            pedestrian village at the base of Whistler and Blackcomb mountains.

              <h4>Cows Ice Cream</h4>
              <p>
                The ice cream is handmade and
                made
                of using the
                highest quality ingredients, including 16% butterfat. Our old-fashioned recipe is churned slowly, adding
                limited amounts
                of air so each bite of ice cream is creamy and packed with flavour! Every scoop contains fresh cream,
                real
                eggs, and is
                served in a handmade waffle cone.

              <p>
                Creekbread at Creekside is our first British Columbia effort. What a setting
                we have to bake
                flatbreads… in the heart of the Canadian Coast Mountains! Our crew is energized by the surrounding and
                when you come in,
                we want to make you happy. The Whistler-Creekside community has shown us tremendous gracious support and
                it is our job
                to return it with interest.
