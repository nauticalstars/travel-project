          <h2>Why Whistler?</h2>
          <h3>One of the largest ski resorts in North America</h3>
          <p>
            Whistler is a town north of Vancouver, British Columbia, that's home to Whistler Blackcomb, one of the
            largest
            ski
            resorts in North America. Besides skiing and snowboarding, the area offers snowshoeing, tobogganing and ski
            jumping at
            the Olympic Park, a venue for the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics. The hub of Whistler is a compact,
            chalet-style
            pedestrian village at the base of Whistler and Blackcomb mountains.

            <h4>Cows Ice Cream</h4>
            <p>
              COWS began to make ice cream in 1983 with an old-fashioned family recipe that originated in Cavendish,
              Prince Edward
              Island.

              In a very short time, the demand for COWS Ice Cream and products increased dramatically, and COWS quickly
              became a
              Prince Edward Island symbol. Despite the growth that COWS experienced, the same old-fashioned ingredients
              are still used
              today when making the 32+ flavours that are produced in Charlottetown. The ice cream is handmade and made
              of using the
              highest quality ingredients, including 16% butterfat. Our old-fashioned recipe is churned slowly, adding
              limited amounts
              of air so each bite of ice cream is creamy and packed with flavour! Every scoop contains fresh cream, real
              eggs, and is
              served in a handmade waffle cone.

            <h5>What I like about it</h5>
            <p>They have many different flavours available. They make the waffle cones daily, and they also sell other
              things like shirts and snacks. The milkshakes are also really good.</p>
